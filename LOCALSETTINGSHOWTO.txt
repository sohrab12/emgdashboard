The idea here is that you want to make a local_settings.py file that looks something like:


DEBUG = True

DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'           # 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
DATABASE_NAME = 'dashboard.db'             # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
DATABASE_USER = ''             # Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''         # Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_HOST = ''             # Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_PORT = ''             # Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3

MEDIA_ROOT = '/Users/emrys/Code/emgdashboard/static/'  #absolute path to media

TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    "/Users/emrys/Code/emgdashboard/templates",
)


We first declare DEBUG to be True so we get handy error feedback, then we specify what sort of database you want to use on your local system (probably sqlite 3 as above), and then you fix the absolute paths. And that's that.

The defaults in settings.py should be production defaults. For instance, on our production server, DEBUG should be False, for obvious reasons. On the production server, we'll also use a real SQL server.
